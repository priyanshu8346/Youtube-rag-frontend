[Live Demo](https://priyanshu8346.github.io/Youtube-rag-frontend/)

This is the frontend for the YouTube RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project. It allows users to paste a YouTube video URL, loads the transcript, and then ask questions about the video using an AI-powered chatbot.

## Features
- Paste any YouTube video URL and load its transcript (if available)
- Ask questions about the video content and get instant answers
- Beautiful, modern, and responsive UI built with Material UI
- Glassmorphism card effect and animated chat bubbles
- Mobile-friendly and desktop-ready

## How It Works
1. Paste a YouTube video URL and click "Load".
2. The app fetches the transcript using the backend.
3. Ask any question about the video in the chat box.
4. The AI will answer based on the transcript and context.
